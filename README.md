# Road-Accident-Analysis-Power-BI:
Designed an in depth tracking and analysis report for recurring traffic incidents, highlighting the proficiency in data visualization and analysis. Developed
a comprehensive tracking and analysis report for recurrent traffic accidents, demonstrating proficiency in data analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure:
- Data: Contains the raw data files used for analysis.
- Scripts: Includes any scripts or code used in the data transformation process.
- Visualizations: Stores the Power BI files and exported images of visualizations.
- Docs: Documentation files, including this README.

## Insights:
- The current year's totals for casualties and accidents are 195.7k and 144.4k respectively.
- Records show that the rate of accidents and casualties has decreased by -11.7% and -11.9%, respectively, over the previous year.
- Out of the 195.7k casualties and 144.4k accidents, 155.8k casualties and 144.4k accidents were caused by cars.
- With 1,55,804 casualties, cars had the highest rate, followed by bikes with 15,610.
- A single carriageway road type accounts for about 145k of the total 195.7k casualties.

## Key Learnings:
- Created a tracking and analysis report for recurrent traffic accidents.
- Created a calculative column and measures using DAX formula.
- Created a relationships between two tables, joined new tables, calculation to manipulate the data and enable user driven parameters for visualization.
- Grouped the fields into the specific category to get the better visuals.
- KPI indicators have been added in order to compare the two different values and determine how many casualties and accidents occurred this year compared to last year.
- Created a slicers that allows users to filter the data dynamically by selecting the specific values, so that users can focus on the information relevant to their analysis.
- Used different types of customized visualization(Area Chart, Stacked Bar Chart, Donut Chart, Pie Chart, Maps, Slicers, etc...).
